		<div class="wood">Random text 1</div>
		<div class="cross">The investor with a stock portfolio having such book values behind
			it can take a much more independent and detached view of stock-market
			fluctuations than those who have paid high multipliers of both earnings
			and tangible assets.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="second">
		<div class="wood">Random text 2</div>
		<div class="cross">As long as the earning power of his holdings remains satisfactory,
			he can give as little attention to the vagaries of the stock market. At times he
			can use these vagaries to play the master game of buying low and selling high.</div>
	</div>

	<div id="third">
			<div class="wood">Random text 3</div>
			<div class="cross">This optimism had no justification in the companyâ€™s earnings
				record in the preceding years, and it proved completely wrong.
				Instead of advancing rapidly, the course of earnings in the ensuing
				period was generally downward.</div>
